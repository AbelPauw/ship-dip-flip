# ship-dip-flip
This is a small game i made in the Phaser 3 framework, it was a lot of fun to work on and the first real game i ever made. I made all the art myself beside the background.

In this game you play as a small spaceship where the objective is to collect as many stars as possible befoure the comet crashes into the sun. During this you also have to doge small bullets that come out of the sun. the game ends when either you hit something, or the sun gets destroyed. after the game the end score is displayed and you can play again.
